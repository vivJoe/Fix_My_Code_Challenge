# Fix My Code Challenge
  Fix my code is a new type of project, where we'll jump into an existing code 
base and fix it! This is done using pre-written repos as initial files for all 
solutions. I'm not coding anything new, just fixing the existing code base.

This was a project provided by ALX in which I was challenged with debugging 
various programs. The challenges spanned a variety of programming languages 
from C to Python to Javascript to Ruby and more, some of which I was familiar 
with, others of which I was not.
